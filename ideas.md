## Player-driven events

A player (or selected event coordinator) walks around advertising themselves as part of an event
Once that player thinks they are ready, they can trigger an action (spawn an event NPC, open a dungeon, spawn a merchant which can sell items, etc)
When the action is triggered, they are no longer able to "advertise" themselves as the event

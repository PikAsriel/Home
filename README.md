Welcome to `Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Shift!`. This is a highly experimental proof-of-concept fan project, intended to explore the world of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (PMD) as a community-developed multiplayer online game.

It is hoped that this project acts as the spiritual successor to the [`Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Community Project (PMDCP)`](https://github.com/pmdcp). Older versions of PMDCP have been used to build [`Pokemon Mystery Universe (PMU)`](http://www.pmuniverse.net), which serves as an example of the types of games that can be created.

Contributions to this project are encouraged and welcome.

This repository contains general documentation. For more specific details, please visit the appropriate repository!
